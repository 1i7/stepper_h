For Serial.println(int64_t, DEC)
copy patched Print.cpp and Print.h to:

for Arduino platform
~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.6.19/cores/arduino/
for ChipKIT platform
~/.arduino15/packages/chipKIT/hardware/pic32/1.4.3/cores/pic32/

This is required to compile example sketch:

~~~cpp
    Serial.print(sm_x.current_pos, DEC);
~~~

(sm_x.current_pos has int64_t/"long long" data type)

Or remove/replace this line in example sketch,
patched Print is not required to compile stepper_h library core.
